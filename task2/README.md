Enter an integer N. Enter N integers that will form a vector.
The program finds the maximum distance (measured by the positions of the elements) between the extremes of this vector.
An extremum is defined as an element of a vector up to and including a descending sequence, or, conversely, 
before it a descending sequence followed by an ascending sequence. 
The program outputs the item numbers and the distance between them.
